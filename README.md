# RecommendationEngine

Python Recommendation Engine for recommending books to Facebook users. The books were clustered with the k-means algorithm , trained on the dataset about their attributes obtained from the librarythings dataset. After formation of clusters each user was abstracted to a hypothetical book by passing their profile information through an averaging function and plotting the cluster into which it lies. After the cluster had been determined, statistical analysis was done to come up with three most liked books from this cluster.
